        <h3>Great ideas happen when we come together</h3>
        <p>We worked with artists to create unique works of art that visualize collaboration and the great ideas that happen when we build something together. We’re calling it The Canvas <br> Project.</p>
        <p>And should your collaborators be halfway around the world, you can now pick one of these artworks to set the backdrop for your next get-together over <span class="hang_out"><a href="https://meet.google.com/" target="_blank">Hangouts Meet</a></span>.</p>
